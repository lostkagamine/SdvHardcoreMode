# Hardcore Mode for Stardew Valley
Inspired by [this Tweet from @HardDriveMag](https://x.com/harddrivemag/status/1804141998754140305), this mod will erase your save file if you even dare look at the wiki in a browser tab.

It does this by scanning the title of every window open on your computer and erasing everything if any window contains 'Stardew Valley Wiki' in its title.

I taught myself SMAPI in two hours for this.
